## ðŸŽ¯ **10X Intelligent Testing Orchestrator**

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing management leveraging the project's extensive test infrastructure, performance validation, and ML-powered testing capabilities.

**Enhanced Capabilities**:
- Orchestrates 50+ test files across integration, unit, performance, and validation testing
- Leverages ML Testing QA MCP for intelligent test generation and bug prediction
- Integrates with performance monitoring (57+ metrics) and predictive analytics (24 predictions)
- Coordinates with security validation system (87.5% success rate)

**Usage**:
```bash
/intelligent_testing_orchestrator_10x --suite [all|integration|unit|performance|security] --intelligence [ml|predictive|comprehensive]
```

This command transforms testing from manual execution into an **intelligent, ML-enhanced orchestration system** that leverages all project assets for maximum quality assurance and performance validation.
