# /security_intelligence_orchestrator_10x

## üõ°Ô∏è **10X Security Intelligence Orchestrator**

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security intelligence orchestration leveraging the project's existing 5-component security architecture with multi-layer threat detection, real-time validation, and automated response coordination.

**Enhanced Capabilities**:
- Orchestrates all 5 security components (audit_logger, backup_manager, command_validator, content_scanner, path_validator, security_validator)
- Real-time threat detection with comprehensive validation framework
- Integration with dashboard security metrics and MCP coordination
- Multi-layer security analysis combining static and dynamic assessment
- Automated threat response with backup management and audit logging

**Usage**:
```bash
/security_intelligence_orchestrator_10x --mode [comprehensive|threat-detection|compliance|forensics] --target [all|commands|files|network]
```

**Advanced Options**:
```bash
/security_intelligence_orchestrator_10x --mode comprehensive --threat-level high --auto-respond --backup-critical
/security_intelligence_orchestrator_10x --mode threat-detection --real-time --dashboard-alerts --coordination-aware
/security_intelligence_orchestrator_10x --mode compliance --audit-depth full --report-format detailed --mcp-integration
```

This command transforms the existing 5-component security architecture into a **comprehensive, intelligent, and automated security ecosystem** with real-time threat detection, coordinated response, and continuous improvement for maximum protection and minimal performance impact.
