### **Phase 1: Intelligence Foundation** (All Original Depth + PARALLEL EXECUTION)
```yaml
ALL MODES INCLUDE:
  EXECUTE IN PARALLEL - Launch Multiple Sub-Agents Simultaneously:
    Historical Context Agent:
      - /intelligence:retrieve_conversation_context_10x --deep --topic "[mode]"
      
    Intelligence Gathering Agents (3 PARALLEL SUB-AGENTS):
      - Market Intelligence: /intelligence:gather_insights_10x --market "[domain]"
      - Technical Intelligence: /intelligence:gather_insights_10x --technical "[tech_stack]" 
      - Pattern Intelligence: /intelligence:gather_insights_10x --patterns "[project_type]"
    
  SYNCHRONIZATION POINT: Wait for all agents to complete
  
  Mode-Specific Enhancement:
    - Additional MCPs per original command specifications
    - All thinking modes preserved (think/think hard/ultrathink)
    
CRITICAL: You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. 
For maximum efficiency, invoke all relevant tools SIMULTANEOUSLY rather than sequentially.
When gathering intelligence, spawn MULTIPLE PARALLEL SUB-AGENTS to research different aspects concurrently.
