## Key Findings

1. **Configuration Issue**: The MCP server configuration was pointing to the wrong Python file (`wireshark_mcp_complete.py` instead of `enhanced_server.py`). This has been fixed.

2. **Tools Availability**: While the system info tool reports only 9 tools, testing confirms that at least 10 of the 18 tools are functional and callable through the MCP interface.

3. **Permission Handling**: The tools handle permission issues gracefully, using fallback methods (e.g., tcpdump when tshark fails).

4. **File Creation**: Tools successfully create and manipulate PCAP files in `/tmp/` directory.

## Next Steps

To complete testing:
1. Test the remaining 8 tools
2. Verify all tools show up in system info after server restart
3. Create more comprehensive test cases with real network traffic
